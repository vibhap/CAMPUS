							<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
							<p><b>Carbohydrates are the body’s primary energy source. Overall, it is recommended that calories from carbohydrates, 
							specifically complex carbohydrates, make up about half of the calories you consume daily.</b></p>

							<h3>Types of Carbohydrates</h3>
							<p>Carbohydrates are classified as simple or complex based upon their chemical structure, which affects how quickly the sugar 
							is digested and absorbed.</p>
							<p><b>Simple carbohydrates</b> such as fructose in fruit juice or sucrose in table sugar consist of one sugar 
							molecule or two sugar molecules bonded together. Because they are so small, simple sugars require little digestion and are 
							rapidly absorbed. Although this can be beneficial for a quick burst of energy, frequent consumption of food beverages 
							containing simple carbohydrates can contribute to insulin resistance and are often lacking in nutrients.</p>

							<p><b>Complex carbohydrates</b> such as the carbohydrate chains in fiber have three or more sugar molecules and must 
							be broken down into simple carbohydrates before the body can absorb and metabolize the energy. Foods high in complex 
							carbohydrates are recommended because they provide sustained energy in a steady manner and are often higher in 
							nutrients and fiber, which provides additional health benefits.</p>

							<p><b>Refined Carbohydrates</b> such as white flour have been milled to remove bran and germ. Although they contain complex 
							carbohydrates, many of the benefits have been removed through processing, and most contain added simple carbohydrates, 
							such as sugar.</p>

							<h3>Food Sources</h3>
							<p><b>Simple Carbohydrates</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Table sugar (sucrose)</li>
									<li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
									<li>Fruit sugar (fructose)*</li>
									<li>Milk sugar (lactose)</li>
								</ul>
							<p>*While fruit does contain simple sugar, it is also a rich source of other nutrients and should be included in your diet.</p>

							<p><b>Complex Carbohydrates</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Whole grains such as brown rice, oat, whole wheat, quinoa, whole corn, whole grain pastas and cereals, bulgur, and bran</li>
									<li>Beans and Legumes</li>
									<li>Starchy vegetables such as potatoes and corn</li>
									<li>Other vegetables also contain complex carbohydrate, just in smaller amounts, when compared to more starchy vegetables</li>
								</ul>	
									
								<p><b>Refined Carbohydrates</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>White bread</li>
										<li>Pasta</li>
										<li>Baked goods with white flour</li>
										<li>White rice</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Function</h3>
								<p>Glucose is critical for all body cells and needs to be in constant supply in the blood stream.</p>

								<p>Carbohydrates break down into glucose, are absorbed into the bloodstream and then are transported throughout the body. 
								Blood glucose levels rise after a meal and then fall back after the glucose is delivered to the cells.</p>

								<p>Once the immediate needs of the body have been met, excess glucose is stored in the liver as glycogen. T
								his serves as an "emergency reserve in case blood glucose levels drop too low, but it can only sustain the body 
								for less than one day." When the body is unable to maintain steady glucose levels, diabetes develops. Maintaining 
								diabetics' glucose levels usually requires various hormones, such as insulin and glucagon.</p>

						<div id="Fats">
							<h2>Fats</h2>
								<div id="imgFat">
									<img  src="images/oil.jpg" align="middle" alt="Oil" width="200" height="200"/>
								</div>
							<p><b>Contrary to popular belief that "fat is bad," fat is essential for our bodies to survive. 
							Critical vitamins our bodies need depend on fat for absorption and transport. Fat also gives our brains 
							cues that let us know when we are full.</b></p>

							<h3>Types of Fats</h3>
							<p>All fats are not created equal. There are many structural differences in individual fats, and it’s good to make a few distinctions.</p>

							<p><b>Unsaturated Fats</b> are found primarily in plant foods and are good for heart health and cholesterol levels. Unsaturated fats also 
							include Omega-3s, a fat group that is essential to heart health.</p>

							<p><b>Saturated Fats</b> are often found in animal products and can raise your "bad" cholesterol levels and 
							increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

							<p><b>Trans Fats</b> occur as a result of a process called "hydrogenation" resulting in qualities that are desirable in food manufacturing 
							such as a higher melting point or a longer shelf life. However, trans fats increase the risk of coronary heart disease. 
							Health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be reduced to trace amounts.</p>

							<h3>Food Sources</h3>
							<p><b>Unsaturated Fat</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Plant oils such as olive, canola, and soy</li>
									<li>Avocados</li>
									<li>Nuts, seeds, and their oils</li>
									<li>Fish, including salmon and sardines</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Saturated Fat</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Most meats*</li>
									<li>Dairy products (except non-fat)</li>
									<li>Tropical oils including palm and coconut</li>
								</ul>
							<p>*Most animal products have both saturated and unsaturated fat. Grass-fed beef has a higher ratio of unsaturated fat 
							than beef fed a grain-based diet.</p>

							<p><b>Trans Fat</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Many packaged snack foods</li>
									<li>Many fried foods</li>
									<li>Many commercial baked goods</li>
									<li>Most margarine and shortening</li>
								</ul>
							<p>Look for the words hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated on nutrition labels. Trans fats must be 
							labeled as such, making them easier to avoid.</p>

							<h3>Function</h3>
							<p><b>Fat is critical to the absorption of nutrients, brain function and heart health. Fat also sends satiety cues to 
							our brains that tell us we are full, and provides the body with cushion and insulation and provides flavor to our foods.</b></p>

							<p>Overall, fats should comprise about 30 percent of the calories you consume daily, mostly in the form of healthy 
							unsaturated fats. Trans fats should be avoided.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="Proteins">
							<h2>Protein</h2>
							<div id="imgProtein">
								<img  src="images/protein.jpg" align="middle" alt="Protein" width="200" height="200"/>
							</div>
							<p><b>Protein is essential because it provides structure for many parts of the body. Our bones, skin and hair are made 
							of collagen—a mix of proteins and minerals. Protein is also vital for maintaining lean body muscle and provides energy 
							for the body.</b></p>

							<h3>Food Sources</h3>
							<p>Protein from animal sources is almost always “complete protein”, which means that the food contains all nine 
							essential amino acids. Although vegetal sources of protein are usually lacking in one or more essential amino acids, 
							or incomplete, it is possible to obtain all of the essential amino acids needed by eating a variety of vegetal sources 
							of protein. It is also important to keep in mind that vegetal sources of protein such as beans and legumes, nuts, and 
							whole grains, are often accompanied by other healthy nutrients and fiber.</p>

							<p><b>Animal Food Sources of Protein</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Meat, fish, poultry</li>
									<li>Eggs</li>
									<li>Dairy products</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Vegetal Food Sources of Protein</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Beans and legumes</li>
									<li>Nuts</li>
									<li>Whole grains</li>
									<li>Soy products (complete protein)</li>
									<li>Vegetables (minimal amounts of protein)</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Complementary Proteins</b></p>

							<p>When two sources of vegetal protein are lacking in different amino acids, but together provide all nine essential 
							amino acids, they are considered to be “complementary.” Complementary proteins do not have to be consumed at the same 
							time to provide the benefits of all nine essential amino acids.</p>

							<p><b>Examples of Complementary Proteins</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Beans and rice</li>
									<li>Nut butter on toast</li>
									<li>Hummus with pita bread</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Function</h3>
							<p><b>Proteins are composed of amino acids, the "building blocks" of protein.</b></p>

							<p>There are about 20 amino acids with almost half of them considered "essential." This means that the body can't produce 
							them, so they need to be obtained through food. The proteins eaten at each meal do not get directly used by the body. 
							Instead, they are digested and broken down into amino acids that are absorbed and transported throughout the body. 
							Individual amino acids are then used to build the body's essentials, ranging from enzymes and hormones to 
							collagen and antibodies.</p>

							<p>About 20% of your daily calories should come from protein.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="Vitamins">
							<h2>Vitamins</h2>
							<div id="imgVitamin">
								<img  src="images/vitamins.jpg" align="middle" alt="Vitamins" width="200" height="200"/>
							</div>
							<p><b>Vitamins are organic compounds obtained from plants and animals that are required in small amounts.</b></p>

							<h3>Types of Vitamins</h3>
							<p><b>Water-soluble vitamins</b> include all B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, B6, B12), vitamin C and folate. 
							They are essential for many metabolic processes to occur. By definition, water-soluble vitamins can exist freely in 
							water so once food is digested, they are absorbed right into the bloodstream and transported to cells throughout the body.</p>

							<p><b>Fat-soluble vitamins</b> include vitamins A, D, E and K. They cannot exist freely in water, but need certain 
							carriers (lipoproteins) for transport in the blood to various parts of your body. They are then stored in fat cells 
							throughout your body and used when needed.<p>

							<h3>Food Sources</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Fresh fruits and vegetables of many colors and types</li>
									<li>Whole grains, legumes, nuts and healthy oils</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Function</h3>
							<p>Vitamins are essential for the function of practically every organ in the body.</p>

							<p>Whether absorbed directly from foods, or stored by the body for later use, vitamins are a critical part of a 
							balanced diet. The body can't make vitamins. Different foods contain different vitamins, so it's essential to 
							consume a variety of healthy foods.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="Minerals">
						<h2>Minerals</h2>
							<div id="imgMinerals">
								<img  src="images/minerals.jpg" align="middle" alt="Minerals" width="200" height="200"/>
							</div>
							<p><b>Minerals are inorganic compounds required in small amounts that are obtained in foods by way of water and soil. 
							Minerals are as important to our diet as vitamins. Each one has a specific job to perform—from cellular functions to 
							building our teeth and bones.</b></p>

							<h3>Types of Minerals</h3>
							<p><b>Major minerals</b> that are found in large quantities in our bodies include calcium, phosphorous, sodium and potassium.</p>

							<p><b>Trace minerals</b> are found only in minute quantities and include iron, zinc, copper, iodine and selenium.</p>

							<h3>Food Sources</h3>
							<p><b>Calcium</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Vegetables-  dark leafy greens, broccoli</li>
									<li>Fruit- oranges, papaya</li>
									<li>Nuts and seeds</li>
									<li>Beans and legumes</li>
									<li>Dairy products- (milk, yogurt, cheese)</li>
									<li>Fish with soft bones</li>
									<li>Fortified soy products</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Phosphorus</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)</li>
									<li>Meat, poultry and fish</li>
									<li>Eggs</li>
									<li>Nuts</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Iron</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Meat, poultry, fish, shellfish</li>
									<li>Beans, lentils, pumpkin seeds</li>
									<li>Enriched breads and cereals</li>
									<li>Green leafy vegetables</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Potassium</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
									<li>Yogurt and dairy products</li>
									<li>Legumes</li>
									<li>Fish</li>
								</ul>
							<p><b>Sodium</b></p>

							<p>Americans should reduce their sodium intake  to less than 2,300mg per day, or less than 1,500mg per day for individuals 
							age 51 and older, those with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, and African Americans</p>

							<h3>Function</h3>
							<p>Minerals help with both bone formation and the maintenance of healthy fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>

							<p>Minerals form the building blocks of strong bones and play a role in transmitting nerve impulses. 
							Some minerals play a part in the manufacture of the body’s hormones and are needed to maintain a normal heartbeat.</p>

							<p>When people don't get enough of critical minerals, they can have health problems. For instance, too little calcium 
							can lead to weaker bones, and too little potassium can lead to poor muscle function One exception is sodium, which is linked 
							with cardiovascular problems and should be consumed in limited amounts. Most people don't need mineral supplements if they eat 
							a nutritious diet.</p>
